# Dashboard

This is just a standalone python web application that may serve as example for something that could be dockerized. The example is copied from the plotly dash documentation.

- This example should evolve into a practicle example that uses `gunicorn` for serving, and possibly an optional database connection to retrieve data that is to be plotted.
